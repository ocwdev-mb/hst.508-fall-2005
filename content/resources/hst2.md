This resource includes information on the basic forces of evolution; neutral evolution and drift, computing ?gene geneaologies? forwards and backwards;
the coalescent; natural selection and its discontents, the evolution of nucleotides and phylogenetic analysis and measuring selection: from classical methods to modern
statistical inference techniques.
